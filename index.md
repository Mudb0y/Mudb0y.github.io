# Welcome!

Maybe you've stumbled upon this website by mistake, maybe you have reached it via the power of the all mighty search
engines, or maybe someone sent you a link of this random kid beeing nerdy and writing down his thoughts, findings, and
various other shinanigans. Either way, hello.

My name is Stanislaw Przedzinkowski. I'm a 16 year old tech enthusiast. Mostly interested in Unix, Linux, hacking Apple
hardware and retro tech.

I mess around with creating some music in my free time. I've never released anything out to the public, but hopefully I'll
be able to throw something that doesn't sound like it comes from a Chinese bootleg console together soon, and then we'll
see.

If you have any questions, or just want to scream at me for my cringy writing of a newbie, feel free to [shoot me an
Email](mailto:stasprzecinek@gmail.com).
