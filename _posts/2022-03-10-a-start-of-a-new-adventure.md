Today I decided I'll start blogging.

The idea appeared in my head long ago, but I never really had the motivation to do it. My sort of pesemistic view was
mostly related to the fact I'll probably get no income out of doing this, and where will I host it without income, and
who will even read what I'll post, ETC.

I remembered a small little detail though. The fact that quite a few people host their blogs on Github pages. So me
being me, I looked, and sure enough, I found an article, on a Github pages blog, that explained how to set this up with
Jekyll. So that's what I have here. A blog that uses a static site generator, fairly straight forward, just write your
content in markdown, push and you're good to go.

I'm still very new to this, both blogging, writing and static site generators, so excuse me for any inconsistancies or
errors you'll find on the site. Let me know if there's a bug / something I should look over and iron out, and I'll try to fix
it. Alternatively just create a pull request with the changes.

Make sure to let me know what you think about this idea that got formed in my head, and if I should continue doing this.
